# Moonwalker-build

University project for the 3rd year subject for IMY 300 at the University of Pretoria.

This is a game. It is a difficult 2D platformer where you controller a spaceman abducted by aliens, who is subjected to various tests.

The project was completed using an older version of Unity (Unity 2017.X.X), but the source code does compile with the 2020 LTS version of Unity.
This consists of only the build for Moonwalker. For queries regarding the source code of Moonwalker, please contact me.
